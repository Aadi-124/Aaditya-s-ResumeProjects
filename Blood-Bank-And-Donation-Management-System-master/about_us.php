<h1><u>About Us</u></h1>
<div class="section">
  <p>Blood bank is a place where blood bag that is collected from blood donation events is stored in one place. The term “blood bank” refers 
    to a division of a hospital laboratory where the storage of blood product occurs and where proper testing is performed to reduce the risk of transfusion related events . The process of managing the blood
     bag that is received from the blood donation events needs a proper and systematic management. The blood bag must be handled with care and treated thoroughly as it is related to someone’s life.
      The development of Web-based Blood Bank And Donation Management System (BBDMS) is proposed
     to provide a management functional to the blood bank in order to handle the blood bag and to make entries of the individuals who want to donate blood and who are in need.
